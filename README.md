# Local DJ Music Library Management System

This project provides a lightweight, executable script for DJs to automatically organize and manage their music libraries on their laptops, ensuring compatibility with DJ equipment.

## Features

- Sort music files by compatibility based on user-defined criteria (e.g., file formats and sample rates).
- Organize music files into user-defined folders based on genre, BPM, or key.
- Run the entire system locally without the need for complex setups or external dependencies.
- Use Python 3.x and `pydub` for audio file processing.
- Command-line interface for easy use.
- Basic logging of operations.
- Basic error handling for common file-related issues.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your laptop.
2. Install the `pydub` library using `pip install pydub`.
3. Run the script via the command line with `python3 main.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to input compatibility criteria and destination folder for sorted files.
